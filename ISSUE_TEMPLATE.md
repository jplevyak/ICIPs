If you would like to submit a ICIP, submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dfinity/ICIPs/pulls).

If you would like to get some feedback on the idea before submitting a ICIP, then continue opening an Issue as a thread for discussion or start a discussion on [Discussion](https://github.com/dfinity/ICIPs/discussions). Discussing ideas before writing a ICIP is meant to save the potential author time since it is more efficient to discuss outside of a PR.

See the guidelines at [ICIP-1](./ICIP-1.md):
